ADGM Companies Regulations 2020 (summary)

Key points:
- Jurisdiction: Corporate and commercial disputes should reference ADGM Courts.
- Company incorporation typically requires: Articles of Association, Memorandum of Association, Board and Shareholder Resolutions, Incorporation Application Form, UBO Declaration Form, and the Register of Members and Directors. Changes of Registered Address require appropriate notices.
- Ensure documents follow ADGM templates and avoid referencing onshore UAE or Dubai Courts when the governing jurisdiction is ADGM.
- Use clear, enforceable language. Avoid ambiguous or non-binding phrasing like "best efforts" or "as appropriate" unless appropriately defined.
- Include proper signatory sections for authorized signatories.
